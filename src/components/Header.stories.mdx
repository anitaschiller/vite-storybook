# Header component

## Header with gradient headline

TODO: Write a story for the Header component giving it a title and two arbitrary colors.

_QUESTION: When clicking on the Docs tab, the header will be positioned on top of the screen covering other parts of the page or variants of the header. They will be lying on top of each other.
Can you change the position dynamically from fixed to static if a certain prop is given?_  
👇🏽 **Goal: Bring the Header back into the regular document flow.** 👇🏽
